## Daily process

### Every day

- Working hours daily - to 1030pm; prep to have last commits/merges for night ready by then.
- Check in when you start working for the day, check in every hour after that with your current task's progress.
- Check out when finishing for the night or leaving before end of day.

#### On Campus

- Morning standup started (**by yesterday's Taskmaster**) @ ~ 10:40am
- New roles assigned (**by yesterday’s Taskmaster**)
- Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (**by today’s Taskmaster**)
- Pair program on assigned tasks where needed
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- At 2:30pm, after Lunch have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

### Team Expectations

- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
- Share the mic
- Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
- At least message the group when you change what you are working on

### Issues

If the group is divided on a certain decision, we will take the following steps:

1. Take 10-15 minute break
2. List out the pros / cons
3. Vote on it
4. If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor

If you are frustrated:

1. Take a walk or get some water
2. Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
3. Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
